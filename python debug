ipython reports error "operation on closed files", this is a bug of ipython.
can be solved by using native python console in spyder

h5py reports 'no internal conversion method for ('U<8')', this is a bug of numpy and h5py
h5py doesn't support numpy encoded strings.
can be solved by explicitly encode numpy strings into 'utf-8' format by:
  strs = [s.encode('utf-8') for s in strs]
  
h5py doesn't support native python dict, has to concert to strings before storing to disk
using json to serialise dict into string format
      times = {"train_time":train_time,
             "test_time":test_time,
             "predict_time":predict_time,
             "total_time":total_time}
      times = json.dumps(times)
      
      times = json.load(times)
