Hashing III
Open addressing
Uniform Hashing Analysis
Criptography Hashing

Open addressing(to solve clision)
no chaining

one item per slot so m>= n		m size of table number of elements
Probing:
	Hash function specifies order of slts to probe for a key (for insert/search/delete)

Example:				
		0:
		1: 586		h(586,1)	h(496,1) --> fails
		2: 133		h(133,1)	h(496,2) --> fails
		3: 496				<--	h(496,3) --> success
		4: 204
		5:
		6: 481 
		7:
		
Search(k):As long as the slots encounted are occupied by keys not equal to k,
keep probing until you either encounter k or find an empty slot

Insert(k,v):
	keep probing until an empty slot is found. 
	Insert the value k to that postion.

Uniform Hashing Assumption
Each key ie equal likely to have any one of the m! permutation on its probe sequence.
