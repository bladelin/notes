Linear time sorting

Comparison model:
--all input items are black boxes(ADTs)(Abstract Data Type)
--only operation allowed are comparisons
--time cost = number of comparisons

Decision Tree:
--only comparison algorithm can be viewed as a tree of all possible comparisons & outcomes
and resulting answer for any particular n
Ex. binary search
